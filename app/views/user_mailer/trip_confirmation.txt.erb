Validation of your ad

Hello,

You have just submitted a trip proposal on carpooling-libre.fr. Your ad has been registered but it must be validated to be published on the site.

Your ad : <%= trip_steps_breadcrumb(@trip) %>, the <%= l @trip.departure_date, format: :long %> to <%= @trip.departure_time.try(:strftime, "%k:%m") %>

Confirm your ad: visit <%= url_for(confirm_trip_url(@trip)) %>

You will then receive a message to manage your ad (modify, create the return trip, delete ...)

Best regards

The team
